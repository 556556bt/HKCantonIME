### Cantonese Romanization 
HKCantonIME adopts the following Cantonese Romanization schemes:

* Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanization
* Sidney Lau Romanization
* Speaker common usage

Unlike Jyutping system by Linguistic Society of Hong Kong and Cantonese Pinyin by HKIeD, they are less systematic and consensus by authority. However, they are accustomed by most of HongKonger due to the large exposure, usage and long traditions on naming of peoples, places and streets.
